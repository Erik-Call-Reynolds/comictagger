=General Features=

=== Filename Parsing===

When an archive is opened, and it has no tags, ComicTagger will attempt to parse the filename to glean some information.  Generally, it expects a format similar to this:

{{{
SERIES_NAME vVOLNUM ISSUENUM (of COUNT) (YEAR).ext
}}}

i.e.

{{{
Plastic Man v1 002 (1942).cbz
Blue Beetle 02.cbr
Crazy Weird Comics 2 (of 2) (1969).rar
}}}

(In this scheme, the YEAR refers to publication year of the issue.)

The cleaner the original filename is, the better ComicTagger is at matching online.

===Auto-Select===

ComicTagger uses an image processing technique to compare the cover image of an archive with images found online to determine the correct metadata.  

When an online search and auto-select is attempted, ComicTagger will use the series name, issue number, and optionally the publication year to find the best match.  Once the list of possibilities is narrowed, it will compare cover images to find the right choice. 

_(If the filename parsing failed to properly fill in the series name and number, you can manually enter those fields before you do the auto-select.)_ 

Obstacles to this process are alternate covers, duplicate covers ( such as multiple editions with the same numbering and virtually identical covers), improperly or poorly named files, and mis-sequenced cover images in the archive.

The settings allow the user to mitigate some of these problems by blacklisting certain publishers, and narrowing the name matching.

===Caching===

ComicTagger caches online search results and images from ComicVine in a temporary database to improve speed when doing similar searches repeatedly. 

=== RAR Tools ===

In order to read and write RAR and CBR archives, you will need to download tools from [http://www.win-rar.com/download.html WinRAR]. You may need to specify the tool locations via the settings/preferences dialog.

ComicTagger uses the command-line tools "rar" and "unrar", which, despite the warnings of the WinRAR GUI, don't seem to expire.  So, no need to pay!

===Rename===

Currently, renaming is only on the command-line, and is very limited.  This feature will be expanded and enhanced, eventually.

===Settings===
ComicTagger keeps the program settings (and caches) in a special folder.  On Windows, you might find it in a folder like:

<code language="bat">
C:\Users\usrname\AppData\roaming\ComicTagger
</code>

This might be a little different, depending on your version of Windows

On Unix systems, (including Mac) something like this:
<code language="sh">
/Users/username/.ComicTagger
</code>

or 

<code language="sh">
/home/username/.ComicTagger
</code>


The settings for the app affect both GUI and CLI mode.  If you're using the GUI, everything in the settings folder can be changed via the app.
If only using CLI mode, you might want to edit things such as RAR program location, and identifier settings.

The setting file itself is a standard "ini" format, and very human-readable.

{{{
[settings]
rar_exe_path = /usr/local/bin/rar
unrar_exe_path = /usr/local/bin/unrar

last_selected_data_style = 0
last_opened_folder = /Users/username/mycomics
last_main_window_width = 959

last_main_window_y = 250

}}}

= GUI User Guide =

The GUI is for the most part pretty intuitive.  You open a file via the menu, or by drag-and-drop, edit the tag fields, and save.  But a some portions deserve a few words.

=== Tag Style Drop-down ===

The "Tag Style" drop-down selection in the upper corner selects how the tags will be saved.  When the style is changed, certain entry fields will change color, and go inactive if those fields won't be saved for the selected style.  For example, the ComicRack tag style doesn't support a field for "Country", so that entry control will be marked red, and made inactive.

This drop-down also affects which tag block will be read in when the user selects the menu choice to "Reload Select Tag Block"

===Page Browser===

Double-clicking on the cover image, or selecting the Page Browser menu option/toolbar button will bring up a very simple page broswer.  It's meant to allow the user to to inspect pages of the archive to glean hints about metadata, and is in no way meant to be a comic reader.


= CLI User Guide =

ComicTagger supports a powerful command-line interface that can be used for batch processing of archives.

On the command-line just invoke the main executable with options.   

On Windows the executable path should be something like this:

<code language="bat">
C:\Program Files\ComicTagger\comictagger.exe
</code>

On Mac something like this:
<code language="sh">
/Applications/ComicTagger.app/Contents/MacOS/ComicTagger
</code>

 Since that is a little ungainly, you might want to consider running the following so you can just use "ComicTagger" from your shell prompt:
 <code language="sh">
 ln -s /Applications/ComicTagger.app/Contents/MacOS/ComicTagger  /usr/local/bin 
 </code>


If running from python source, just run "comictagger.py"

Here are some sample usages, that assume running from bash shell on a Mac or other UNIX system.  If using Mac or Windows binary versions, substitute the correct ComicTagger command, as mentioned above.

Print out the tags for a single file
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -p Plastic_Man_001_.zip
</code>

Print out the ComicRack tags for all CBZ files in the folder
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -p -t cr *.cbz
</code>

Delete the ComicBookLover tags for all CBR files in the folder
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -d -t cbl *.cbr
</code>

Set the ComicRack tags from online for a single file, using the filename to search
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -s -t cr -f  -o Plastic_Man_001_.cbr
</code>

Search online for for a single file, using the specified tags to search, be verbose, and save to ComicRack tags
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -s -t cr -m "series=Plastic Man,issue=1"  -o -v PlasMan001.cbr
</code>

Set the ComicBookLover Publisher tag for a list of files
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -s -t cbl -m "publisher=Quality Comics"   Plastic\ Man*.*

As above, but in "dry run" mode, where it just displays what would be saved
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -n -s -t cbl -m "publisher=Quality Comics"   Plastic\ Man*.*
</code>

Search online for for a list of files, using the filename to search, interactively ask the user at the end (if needed) and save to ComicRack tags
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -s -t cr -f  -o -i *.cbr
</code>

As above, but un-sets any year found in the filenames
<code language="sh">
./comictagger.py -s -t cr -f  -o -i  -m "year=" *.cbr
