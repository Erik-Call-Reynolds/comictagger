=== Filename Parsing===

When an archive is opened, and it has no tags, ComicTagger will attempt to parse the filename to glean some information.  Generally, it expects a format similar to this:

{{{
SERIES_NAME vVOLNUM ISSUENUM (of COUNT) (YEAR).ext
}}}

i.e.

{{{
Plastic Man v1 002 (1942).cbz
Blue Beetle 02.cbr
Crazy Weird Comics 2 (of 2) (1969).rar
}}}

The cleaner the original filename is, the better ComicTagger is at matching online.

===Auto-Select===

ComicTagger uses an image processing technique to compare the cover image of an archive with images found online to determine the correct metadata.  When an online search and auto-select is attempted, ComicTagger will use the series name, issue number, and optionally the publication year to find the best match.  Once the list of possibilities is narrowed, it will compare cover images to find the right choice.  

Obstacles to this process are alternate covers, duplicate covers ( such as multiple editions with the same numbering and virtually identical covers), improperly or poorly named files, and mis-sequenced cover images in the archive.

The settings allow the user to mitigate some of these problems by blacklisting certain publishers, and narrowing the name matching.

= GUI User Guide =

The GUI is for the most part pretty intuitive.  You open a file via the menu, or by drag-and-drop, edit the tag fields, and save.  But a some portions deserve a few words.

=== Tag Style Drop-down ===

The "Tag Style" drop-down selection in the upper corner selects how the tags will be saved.  When the style is changed, certain entry fields will change color, and go inactive if those fields won't be saved for the selected style.  For example, the ComicRack tag style doesn't support a field for "Country", so that entry control will be marked red, and made inactive.

This drop-down also affects which tag block will be read in when the user selects the menu choice to "Reload Select Tag Block"

===Page Browser===

Double-clicking on the cover image, or selecting the Page Browser menu option/toolbar button will bring up a very simple page broswer.  It's meant to allow the user to to inspect pages of the archive to glean hints about metadata, and is in no way meant to be a comic reader.
