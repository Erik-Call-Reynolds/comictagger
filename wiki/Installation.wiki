= Binary Packages=

For Windows and Mac, application packages are available. This is the easiest way to run ComicTagger.

=== Windows ===

Download the installer .exe and run it.  

=== Mac OS X ===

Download the DMG file, open it, and drag the app onto your Desktop or Applications folder.

= Source =

To run ComicTagger from the python source, you will need to install some pre-requisites:

  * Python 2.6 or 2.7
  * PyQt matching the Python version
  * PIL, the Python Imaging Library

See below for some platform-specific details

Once those are in place, just download and extract the source zip file.  Run the file called "comictagger.py"

== Mac OS X ==

Mac has Python installed by default.

Getting PyQt and PIL installed is probably easiest via brew - http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

More TBD.

== Windows ==

Python - http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7.3/
PyQt - http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
PIL - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

== Linux ==
On the Ubuntu 12.10 all requirements should be available already.  On other systems, use the package manager such as apt-get or yum to install whatever is missing.

i.e.
{{{
sudo apt-get install python-pil
}}}
